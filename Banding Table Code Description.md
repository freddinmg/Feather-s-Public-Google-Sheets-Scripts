I made this code when I was working on a code that hides text by changing the color of it to the cell color. It turns out, the "banding" option Google Sheets sets its colors differently than just a simple cell recolor. So, after trial and error, I ended up with this:

The above script will change the text in the relevant ranges to the banding colors. If you change the colors used in the tables then run the formula(s), the text colors will convert.

If you're interested in doing the same, these codes should help!
