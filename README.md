Hey there! I'm freddin here, but I go by a few other names in other places. The main point is: I have a lot of public Google Sheets, and many of them use the Apps Script function. 

While I try to find out a more graceful way to host these scripts, this place will store all of the ones I made so people can download them. They're made for my stuff, but I have absolutely no problem sharing them with the public, since I pieced a lot of these from various Stack Overflow answers lol. I'm still incredibly green when it comes to making this stuff.

At any rate, feel free to browse? If you're here from one of my sheets, I'll try to label these things to make it easy for you.

You can see these sheets here:
